# Data
This folder contains data used for evaluating our methods.

In `motif_problems`, we have the motif scaffolding benchmarks as laid out in [RFDiffusion's Supplementary File Table 1](https://www.bakerlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/RFdiffusion_Manuscript.pdf). In particular, we use the curated PDB files from the [TDS code repository](https://github.com/blt2114/twisted_diffusion_sampler/tree/main/protein_exp/motif_scaffolding).

In `multi_motif_problems`, we have the multi-motif scaffolding benchmarks as introduced in [Genie2's Appendix B Table 4](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.15489).
