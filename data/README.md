# Data
This folder contains data used for evaluating our methods.

In `motif_problems`, we have the motif scaffolding benchmarks as laid out in the [RFDiffusion Supplementary File Table 1](https://www.bakerlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/RFdiffusion_Manuscript.pdf). In particular, we use the curated PDB files from the [TDS code repository](https://github.com/blt2114/twisted_diffusion_sampler/tree/main/protein_exp/motif_scaffolding).
